                                <h3>Chalk and Talk on 'Signal Flow in Communication' by Prof V.Sinha</h3>
                                <p>
                                  The concept of Signals and Systems arise in a wide variety, and the areas and techniques associated with these concepts play an important role in diverse areas of Scienceand Technology. But there are a variety of problems and questions that are of importance and need to be solved and answered. What are those questions?
                                  Prof. V. Sinha, founding Director The LNMIIT, Fellow IEEE answered these 'questions' in this valuable talk on 'Signal Flow in Communication'.                                </p>

                                <h3>Photonics for New Generation Fully-Digital Radar and Wireless Communication Systems by Antonella Bogoni</h3>
                                <p>
                                  The speech will introduce the role of photonics for new generation radar and wireless communication systems. Modern techniques for the photonic-assisted RF generation will be detailed to provide extremely stable multicarrier signals up to the millimeter wave band, with an arbitrary amplitude and phase modulation and phase noise independent on the frequency.
                                  At the receiver photonic technologies will be reported for the optical sampling directly at RF and for the down-conversion of multiple heterogeneous RF signals, allowing an increased resolution.
                                  The innovative transceiver features guaranteed by the use of photonics, will be demonstrated for the development of new generation fully digital multiband single and array radar systems working at high frequency (X band and beyond), and for the design of radically new multi-protocol software- defined wideband wireless communication apparatus.
                                  Finally new applications for safety, traffic and environment control and for new mobile broadband services enabled by the photonic-based radar and wireless communication systems respectively will be summarized.                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  LNMIIT IEEE Student Branch is organising a workshop on Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems in collaboration with Texas Instruments from 29th October to 1st November. The workshop started with an Introductory Talk by the Director, University Programs, Texas Instruments, Mr. Sanjay Srivastava, on 28th October.

                                  The Talk provided the students with an insight of what they were going to learn during the period of the workshop. Students from all years participated enthusiastically.

                                  The event began by honoring the guests with bouquets. Then Prof Raghuvir Tomar gave a brief introduction about the speaker followed by the talk by Mr. Sanjay Srivastava. The question answer round saw lots of keen researchers clearing their doubts regarding this field and the workshop.

                                  In the end, Dr. S.S. Gokhle (Director, LNMIIT) gave his vote of thanks to the honorable guests.

                                <p>
                                  Great advances have been made in the field of bioengineering within the past twenty years, leading to increased incorporation of engineering principles in the fields of biology and medicine. This field holds tremendous potential in solving medical problems and is one of the most researched areas around the globe today.
                                  The scientific program of the workshop is based on plenary presentations by the speakers, with some of the allocated time reserved for in-depth discussion. Distinguished speakers will be invited to participate in the workshop and present topics on their recent work. The workshop will provide a scientific forum for further development and research and will aim to establish new bonds that will bring forward our understanding, and promote technologically successful applications.

                                <p>
                                  Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. Artificial Intelligence has always been a research-rich field with a number of challenging and practically significant problems spanning many areas. These include language processing, multi-agent systems, web mining, information retrieval, semantic web, e-learning etc. Artificial Intelligence, hence can offer a wide range of challenging problems matching the plate of every academic or professional.

                                <p>
                                  Microwave and antennas are used in almost all the communication systems and electronic gadgets starting from the mobile to radar. The aim of workshop is to motivate students and make awareness among the faculty members to learn the latest advancement of the subject, and thus utilize this knowledge in their projects to carve out incredible things. The workshop also aims at developing a general thought about the present and future communication systems. This will be a platform for the students to grab knowledge in the field of Applied Electromagnetics in Defense applications, Antennas Used in EMI/EMC Measurements and about the coming technology of Microwave integrated circuits. The workshop not only focuses on knowing in depth of present technologies in this domain but also believe the students to learn the basics and fundamentals of microwaves. The events are being organized to provide a broad forum for academic interactions with seminars and tutorials on the present cut edge technologies. This would provide an extensive opportunity to the participants for knowledge sharing and exhibition of theoretical and technological development in the general areas of applied Electromagnetics .

                                The IEEE Student Branch at The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur will be hosting the 22nd IEEE Quarterly Meet on 19th January, 2014. Quarterly meets are an integral part of IEEE Student Branches to gather all IEEE Student Branches from all over Delhi Section under one roof. The meet provides an opportunity for students and faculty members to interact with other IEEE branches in the region, discuss the problems faced by the fellow branches and provides an excellent platform to collaborate and network. This meet will be a one day event having a footfall of about 100 students from colleges of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The event comprises of Guest Lecture, Launch of Women in Engineering (WIE) affinity group at LNMIIT, Group Activities and Problem Solving Session. Prof. Damyanti Gupta, Department of Political Science, University of Rajasthan. has kindly consented to grace the meet and enlighten us with her words of wisdom. She has been the Head of the Department of Political Science, and has even served as the Director of UGC Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy at the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur. She has to her credit a number of books and articles published such as State and Globalization edited by Roop Singh Bareth & Damyanti Gupta, Gendered Violence Endangered Women, Political Thought and Interpretation – The Linguistic Approach. We are immensely grateful to have her as the Chief Guest of the Meet. Her esteemed presence would surely enlighten us all at the 22th IEEE Quarterly Meet at LNMIIT

                                IEEE student Branch aims to inculcate knowledge based learning in the students of our college. The vision of IEEE Student Branch at LNMIIT is to ensure the continuous efforts in learning to bring the era of technology and innovation. The faculties and students are bonafide for the progress of the institution. It aims to rejuvenate the students with the spirit to bring their creativity by indulging them in the projects, funding opportunities, summer internships and most importantly a friendly interaction between faculty and students at LNMIIT. Though this is a very small aim at primary level to achieve something at a small unit like LNMIIT but we as IEEE student body feel this is important to help them to collaborate with the people out their with the aims and objectives of achieving something big. The mission of IEEE WIE is to facilitate the global recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines. IEEE WIE envisions a vibrant community of IEEE women and men collectively using their diverse talents to innovate for the benefit of humanity.

                                In a period of 6 Months IEEE WIE LNMIIT organised two major events which are as follows:<br>
